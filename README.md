# Hackthe6ix

Using predictive AI technology we created Prophecy, a tool that predicts the future value of stocks.

We built this using tf and keras for the machine learning and scikit for preprocessing. The yahoo finance module allowed us to create a live pipeline of information. Finally, html and java script were used in order to create the user interface that tied the front and back end together.
